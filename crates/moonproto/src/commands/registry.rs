//! Command registry — matches MoonProtoBaseStruct.pas:314-348.
//! Channel dispatch by command class is handled in `protocol::Command`; this
//! module holds the shared wire-string codec and the proto command version gate.
//!
//! Wire format of every command:
//!   CmdId (1 byte) + ver (2 bytes u16 LE) + UID (8 bytes u64 LE) + payload
//!
//! Version gate: if `ver` is newer than the concrete command version, skip the
//! command. The current shared version is 4, including the canonical order
//! command set 41..47.
