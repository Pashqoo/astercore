//! Markets sync state maintained from Engine API responses.
//!
//! Update flow:
//! - startup sends `emk_GetMarketsList` and receives the full markets plus CorrMarkets list;
//! - periodic `emk_UpdateMarketsList` updates prices and funding;
//! - cold init derives server `mIndex` order from `emk_GetMarketsList`;
//! - `emk_GetMarketsIndexes` refreshes that order after reconnect/server restart;
//! - periodic `emk_CheckBinanceTags` updates token tags.
