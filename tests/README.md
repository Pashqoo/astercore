# MoonProto Tests

The test suite is split by the layer it protects. Do not treat all tests as
application examples: some are intentionally low-level protocol guards.

## Public Pipeline Tests

- `integration_smoke.rs` is the small live `MoonClient` happy-path smoke test.
  It uses the same shape a desktop app should use: start `MoonClient`, wait for
  `LifecycleEvent::Ready`, read snapshots/events, then disconnect.
- `fire_test.rs` is the live health/stress gate. It also uses the public
  `MoonClient` path, but it enables diagnostics and destructive scenarios to
  prove protocol recovery, retained state, and CPU gates. It is not a sample app.

## Runtime / Protocol Unit Tests

Tests under `src/client/tests/` protect protocol mechanics: handshake,
reconnect, PMTU, send queues, pending Engine API routing, subscriptions, and
wire-compatible timing/retry semantics. They may instantiate internal `Client` or
`EventDispatcher` directly because their job is to lock down machine-effect
parity, not to demonstrate the public API.

Tests under `src/events/tests.rs` and `src/state/**/tests.rs` protect Active Lib
state application and retained read models. Direct state/dispatcher use here is
intentional: these tests prove exact parser/apply behavior without needing a live
server.

## Platform Polling Test

`udp_polling.rs` verifies the OS UDP readiness contract used by the runtime
loop. It is separate from live MoonProto tests because the failure mode is in
socket polling/rearming, not in server behavior.

## Running

Fast deterministic checks:

```powershell
cargo test --lib
cargo test --test udp_polling
cargo check --examples
```

Live smoke:

```powershell
cargo test --test integration_smoke -- --ignored --nocapture
```

FireTest:

```powershell
$env:MOONPROTO_FIRETEST_PROFILE = "quick"
cargo test --release --features diagnostics --test fire_test fire_test_active_library_health -- --exact --ignored --nocapture
```

Set `MOONPROTO_FIRETEST_PROFILE = "full"` for the full health scenario. Keep the
exact name filter: without it, Cargo also runs the separate ignored tests below;
the quick-profile setting does not make those tests read-only.

Focused strategy checks on an updated test core (`allow_mutation = true`):

```powershell
cargo test --release --features diagnostics --test fire_test fire_test_strategy_folder_sync -- --exact --ignored --nocapture
cargo test --release --features diagnostics --test fire_test fire_test_strategy_order_sync -- --exact --ignored --nocapture
```

These create their own strategy/folder fixtures, check two-way delivery plus cold
and reconnected clients, and remove their fixtures. Folder sync covers empty and
nested folders, combined rename/path edits, and deletion. Order sync covers
reorders with and without parameter edits.

`fire_test_core_problems` checks diagnostic-list delivery and test notifications;
see [its opt-in clear behavior](../docs/problems.md#firetest) before running it.

`fire_test_telegram_state` is read-only: initial Telegram state, passive refresh
and a second connection. It never starts login, changes proxy or logs out;
see [Telegram](../docs/telegram.md#firetest).

Focused report replication and archived-trace check (`allow_mutation = true`):

```powershell
cargo test --release --features diagnostics --test fire_test fire_test_report_database_replication -- --exact --ignored --nocapture
```

This creates an emulator trade, moves its BUY and SELL, closes it, and waits for
the closed report row before requesting traces. It checks line types, point
counts, UTC times, prices and segment geometry; repeated requests and an absent
archive must complete with the correct tickets. A client connected after the
trade closed must fetch exactly the same archive using its persisted ReportUID.
It also requires the core's report chart fields: entry creation time must precede
entry completion, corridor prices must be finite and nonnegative, and the offline
SQLite replica must preserve all three values exactly. A plain order may have
zero corridor prices; nonzero prices and reversed DOWN/UP values are covered by
the deterministic report tests.
The gate also checks offline report catch-up and delete/restore, restores the
emulator setting and deleted flag, and leaves the test trade in the report.
It is included in the full FireTest profile as well.

Live retained-memory warmup check (Windows only):

```powershell
cargo test --release --features diagnostics --test fire_test fire_test_retained_memory_warmup -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

This check trims the FireTest process working set, then verifies through the
public `MoonClient` path that its owned history worker restores a materialized
retained ring. It does not mutate the MoonBot server.

Live trades versus the raw chart archive (read-only, about 140 seconds):

```powershell
cargo test --release --features diagnostics --test fire_test history_compare::fire_test_live_trades_vs_raw_archive -- --exact --ignored --nocapture
```

This collects live rows for three markets before requesting any archive, lets
late packets settle, and captures each decoded archive before the history merge.
It writes live/archive/merged CSVs and five-second volume buckets under
`target/history-compare-<timestamp>`. Output includes exact multiset overlap,
BUY/SELL volume totals and physical UDP payload byte counts after Ready.
Different aggregation can change row counts without losing volume. The gate
requires <=3% total-volume difference between independent live/archive data and
between merged/live data through the join; the settled archive-owned region
must match exactly. Repeated requests and a late-packet wait must leave that
region unchanged. This is not a guarantee of zero packet loss.

Quick FireTest is the frequent development gate. Full FireTest is the
destructive/stress gate for “this is a good point” decisions.
