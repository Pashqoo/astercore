# Trade Actions

`MoonClient` provides the normal order-intent API. UI code reads immutable
order snapshots and sends user actions back to the runtime by passing the
visible `&Order`:

OrdersProto packet structs are not trading API. Do not import similarly named
types from the diagnostic-only `moonproto::commands` module; retired packet
commands are removed when the wire protocol changes while these typed handles
remain the application boundary.

```rust
use moonproto::{StopSettings, VStopParams};

let Some(snapshot) = client.snapshot() else { return; };
let Some(order) = snapshot.orders().get(ui_state.selected_order_uid()) else { return; };
let Some(market) = snapshot.markets().find("BTC") else { return; };
let stops = StopSettings::disabled()
    .with_stop_loss_percent(2.5, 0.1)
    .with_take_profit_price(50_500.0);

client.orders().move_order(order, new_price)?;
client.orders().cancel(order)?;
client.orders().update_stops(order, stops)?;
client.orders().update_vstop(
    order,
    VStopParams::percent(50_000.0, 12.0),
)?;
client.orders().set_immune_for_orders([order], true)?;
client.orders().turn_panic_sell(order, true)?;
client.orders().request_status(order)?;
client.orders().switch_panic_sell_for_market(&market, true)?;
```

The runtime owner applies the intent to the live `Orders` state first, then
queues the protocol command only when the current order state allows it. This is
the Active Lib order model: the application does not mutate a snapshot and does
not pass `&mut Orders` around.

## UI Pattern

```rust
if let Some(snapshot) = client.snapshot() {
    if let Some(order) = snapshot.orders().get(ui_state.selected_order_uid()) {
        println!(
            "buy_actual={} buy_qty={} sell_actual={} sell_qty={}",
            order.buy_order.actual_price,
            order.buy_order.quantity,
            order.sell_order.actual_price,
            order.sell_order.quantity
        );
        client.orders().move_order(order, new_price)?;
    }
}
```

Snapshots are display/read models. They are safe to keep in UI state, but they
are not the live order-worker state. The live state remains inside the runtime,
where replace-in-flight, pending cancel, previous Stops/VStop, panic, and immune
flags are checked exactly once before sending.

`move_order` is safe to call again while an earlier move is still in flight.
The runtime keeps the newest UI target, and the protocol send queue coalesces an
older move that has not yet been copied by the writer.

## Market Trade Intents

New orders and market-level actions use `client.trade()`. User code supplies a
retained market handle (or a market name in scripts); canonical v4 commands
serialize that market name directly:

```rust
use moonproto::{
    ClosePositionParams, NewOrderParams, OrderSide, PendingOrderParams, SplitOrderParams,
};

let Some(snapshot) = client.snapshot() else { return; };
let Some(market) = snapshot.markets().find("BTC") else { return; };

let _ticket = client.trade().new_order(
    NewOrderParams::for_market(&market, OrderSide::Long, 50_000.0, 250.0)
        .with_strategy_id(strategy_id),
)?;

let _pending_ticket = client.trade().new_pending_order(
    PendingOrderParams::for_market(&market, OrderSide::Long, 49_000.0, 250.0)
        .with_strategy_id(strategy_id),
)?;

client.trade().join_orders_for_market(&market, OrderSide::Long)?;
if let Some(order) = snapshot.orders().iter().find(|order| {
    order.market_name == market.name()
}) {
    client.trade().split_order(SplitOrderParams::new(order, 3))?;
}
client.trade().close_position(ClosePositionParams::for_market(&market))?;
client.trade().close_position(ClosePositionParams::market_order_for_market(&market))?;
client.trade().limit_close_position_for_market(&market, OrderSide::Long)?;
client.trade().penalty_for_market(&market)?;
```

Position and bulk actions have explicit meanings:

| Action | API |
|---|---|
| Split the current position with limit-order semantics | `split_position_for_market(&market, side)` |
| Split the current position with market-order semantics | `market_split_position_for_market(&market, side)` |
| Place the normal closing limit flow | `close_position(ClosePositionParams::for_market(&market))` |
| Force a market close | `close_position(ClosePositionParams::market_order_for_market(&market))` |
| Move all matching buys or sells | `move_all_buys_for_market(...)` / `move_all_sells_for_market(...)` |
| Trigger the one-shot global panic-sell action | `panic_sell_all()` |

Bulk buy/sell moves use named constructors for the trader-visible mode. The
runtime still serializes the matching core packet internally:

```rust
use moonproto::{BulkMoveKind, MoveAllBuysParams, PositionFilter};

client.trade().move_all_buys_for_market(
    &market,
    MoveAllBuysParams::replace_kind(BulkMoveKind::TopVolume, 50_100.0, PositionFilter::Long),
)?;
```

The legacy `penalty` command is the sole public trade helper that still needs
the BaseCheck currency/exchange route. It returns
`MoonClientError::TradeContext` when those fields are unavailable. Canonical v4
order actions do not depend on those route bytes.

Manual strategy mode is an application decision, matching MoonBot UI behavior.
When settings say `use_manual_strategy` and the trader selected
`manual_strategy_id`, pass that id with `NewOrderParams::with_strategy_id`.
Leaving the strategy id empty sends zero and delegates to the core: when its
manual-strategy mode is enabled, the core can attach the configured Manual
strategy. Pass an explicit id when the terminal needs deterministic strategy
ownership.
If the manual strategy sell-percent control changes, send the retained strategy
update through `client.strategies().sell_price_update(...)`.

`new_pending_order` creates a pending inside the core. Its
`trigger_price` is the watched condition, not the final exchange-order price;
the core applies its configured pending spread when the trigger fires. The
`size` uses the core account's balance currency (normally USD/USDT for a
USD/USDT core), just like `new_order`.

Without `with_strategy_id`, this command creates a bare pending and does not
inherit the core's configured Manual strategy. With an explicit strategy id,
the core retains that strategy as a candidate while the pending waits and
attaches it only when the trigger fires. Consequently, the waiting order can
still expose `strat_id = 0` in the order snapshot; the attached strategy becomes
visible after the order enters its normal buy phase. `with_market_stop` affects
only compatible candidates: Manual strategies use their own retained setting,
UDP strategies use the command flag, and bare pending orders ignore it.

The pending is published immediately with normal order state, so the terminal
reads it from `snapshot().orders()`, then uses
`client.orders().move_order(...)` or `cancel(...)` exactly as it does for any
other retained order. A long trigger above the current price is a breakout
pending; below the current price it is a pullback pending. Short triggers are
mirrored.

`new_order` returns a client-side ticket with an outbound/local
`client_order_id`. The typed order stream does not echo this value, so it is not
a reliable click-to-order UID mapping. Normal order tables should treat the
order snapshot as the source of truth, key real orders by server `uid`, and
redraw from `snapshot().orders()`.

Order intent handles also accept a raw UID for CLI tools and scripts that only
have an identifier. Desktop UI should prefer the visible `&Order` it already
draws; the runtime still resolves that selector against the live order state
before sending.

Market-level helpers have the same split: terminal UI should keep the selected
`MarketHandle` and call `*_for_market` methods or `...Params::for_market`.
String-keyed methods remain for scripts and one-shot tools.

`SplitOrderParams::new(order, parts)` means the normal equal-parts split of one
selected retained order. The small strategy-piece buttons use
`strategy_piece(order, parts)` or `strategy_piece_and_sell(order, parts)`, so
application code does not pass raw split-mode booleans.

`ClosePositionParams::for_market` means the normal default: place closing limit
orders for the current position. Use `market_order_for_market` only for the
explicit force-market-close button.

## Init Gate

`MoonClient::connect` starts the runtime immediately, while the one-time
connect/init sequence finishes in that runtime thread. UI code may enqueue order
intents during startup; the runtime handles them only after the retained state is
ready. If the live order no longer exists or its current state does not allow the
requested action, the action becomes a no-op. Normal UI code keeps rendering the
retained order snapshot; low-level rejected-action telemetry is available only
in `test`/`diagnostics` builds.

After Init, actions are non-blocking: the runtime owns packet construction,
send/retry state, and reconnect handling. An intent may still become a no-op if
the referenced live order disappears or changes to an incompatible phase before
the runtime applies it.

## Command Semantics

- `move_order` derives the active leg, current status, target size, and dedup key
  from live `Orders`; the wire action addresses the order by server `uid`.
- `cancel` derives the current status from live `Orders`: an active buy/sell leg
  gets the matching cancel command, while a still-pending order gets the
  addressed pending-cancel command and keeps a local `pending_cancel` mark until
  the server confirms the phase change.
- `update_stops` and `update_vstop` compare against previous local values and
  send only when something changed.
- `set_immune_for_orders` updates only found active local orders and sends
  nothing if no target order exists.
- panic-sell methods update live local panic flags before sending. Turning off
  an auto-activated market panic also disables local stop-loss, trailing-stop,
  and VStop toggles while preserving their numeric settings.
- `client.trade().new_order`, `new_pending_order`, join/split/close/sell and MoveAll commands encode
  canonical market-name payloads. Only the legacy `penalty` command derives a
  `TradeCtx` from the session route.
- `move_all_sells` and `move_all_buys` read the live order state and send only
  when the active-client pre-send gates find a candidate order. The
  replace-kind and price-zone variants skip click-immune orders; the percent
  variant intentionally includes them, matching the core.

Protocol action IDs and current order status are intentionally not
caller-supplied in the normal API. Active Lib owns action-ID generation and
resolves status from the live retained order.

## Retry Counts

Most trade/order actions use the MoonBot retry policy for the matching command.
Position-changing commands that must not be duplicated by retries use the lower
retry count from the core command profile. The high-level API selects this
automatically; applications should not choose retry counts for normal trading
actions.
